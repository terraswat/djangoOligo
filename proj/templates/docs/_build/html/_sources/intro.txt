Introduction
============

This web application retrieves oligos from the UCSC satellite oligo database,
filtering with search terms defined by the user. The user has the opportunity to
rate and comment on an oligo.

The base data is from the 1000 Genomes Project, Phase I.

Information displayed for each oligo includes:

* primer (5'-> 3')
* rating by users
* satellite family
* satellite array name
* frequency observed
* human chromosome, including start and end coordinates of best hit
* low stringency chromosome assignments

Selecting an oligo will give more information, including:

* link to this location in the UCSC Genome Browser
* population counts, grouped by geography
* user comments and rating
